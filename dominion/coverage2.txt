What can be drawn is that unittest1 and unittest2 test the same exact lines of code since they have the exact same coverage amount.
Cardtest2 and Cardtest4 are failing tests and have the smallest coverage of the card tests.
Cardtest1 and Unittest4 have the most coverage, but that doesn't mean they test the most, since both call functions that are tested outside of their test.
