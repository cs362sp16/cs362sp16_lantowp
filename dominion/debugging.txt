(Understand the system) Prior to this instance of debugging, I have been working with dominion.c for several months and was
familar with the underlying game.
(Make it fail) I ran all of my card tests at the same time. I got an error about adding an incorrect number of actions:

Starting game.
FAIL
Village added an incorrect number of actions
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:20.46% of 650
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

(Divide and conquer) Since the error mentioned actions, I looked at the actions in the Village function. I noticed that the 
change in total actions wasn't taking into account the action being spent playing the card, so I reduced the total actions by
1. Upon making this change, I re-tested. My debugger now said:

Starting game.
All tests passed for Village
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:20.46% of 650
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

(Change one thing at a time) Since I only made one change, I can be reasonably certain that that was what was causing the bug.
Since I am no longer getting an error, the bug is now fixed.
