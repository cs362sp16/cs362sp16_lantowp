The color-coding of Tarantula was much more helpful for hunting down bugs than scrolling through pages of monochromatic gcov
files. I decided to tackle a bug I was having with the council room, where it was adding an incorrect number of cards to the
active player's hand. In this case, what mattered was not what was colored, but what wasn't. Feeling confident that the
error was a logic problem inside the council_room functioned, I was suprised to find that it wasn't even colored! Glancing
through the colored sections, I realized that a call to council_room was actually redirecting towards the village card.
After correcting this name, council room became colored in future tarantula calls. Tarantula was very useful, becuase without
it I would have likely wasted much time trying to fix council room, when the real problem was that it was even being called.
