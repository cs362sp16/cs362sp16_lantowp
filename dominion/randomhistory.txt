Improvements:
-Both testers compile now
-Refactored the code so that 233 tests could be performed before memory issues break it, a 1566% improvement from the
original 12.
-Added tests so that both cards are actually tested.
-Shuffled up the deck for additional randomization.
-Added random numbers of actions.

An early error I found in my tests was that if there were already were treasure cards in hand, then adventure would fail the
tests even though it had correctly added two treasure cards. 

My assumption for the Village card was the the player would have only one action, which would be expended on playing Village.
However, this proved to be a faulty assumption and I expanded the test to be for the difference in actions from when the card
was played to afterwards.
