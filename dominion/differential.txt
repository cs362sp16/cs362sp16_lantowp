The full diff can be found here: https://www.diffchecker.com/ukeubr50. The comparison was made with foulgerd's code.

There were 207 removals and 183 additions. Both games had the same number of players, 3. 
The games played exactly the same, until about 15 turns in which foulgerd purchased a Smithy instead of Silver.
From this divergence points the games continued to play slightly different from each other. I can only assume the difference
is due to the random seed eventually diverging after several hundred numbers had been generated.
