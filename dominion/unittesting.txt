I enjoy being able to have a code coverage percentage available, but I wish there was an easier way to see which functions
had coverage and which didn't. I also found that I needed to use functions within the program to help with the tests, 
which means that if this were a full project I would need to create tests for those functions as well. Testing for complicated
functions with no return value seems like it'll be difficult going forward.
